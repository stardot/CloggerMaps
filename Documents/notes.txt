The levels in the SLIPPER file start at 0xf7d. There are 5 levels per file.

Each level consists of 32 by 32 tiles, stored using one byte per tile.
Values 0x00 to 0x0f are ordinary scenery or collectable tiles, tiles 0x26 to
0x2a are moveable objects, and tiles 0x10 to 0x24 are puzzle pieces.

Loading the SLIPPER file at 0x5403 in order to align the graphics to rows on
screen, it appears that the wall sprite starts at 0xabd.

Puzzle pieces are arrays of 4 by 4 blocks, with at least six different
colours: black, dark blue, blue, red, yellow and light blue. This means that
each piece should require at least 3 bits per block, so 12 bits per row, and
48 bits in total. Since each piece will be 6 bytes in total and there are 21
for each puzzle, we should look for sections of 126 bytes in length in each
level file.

If there are more bits required to represent a block then there will be
correspondingly more bytes required to represent a puzzle. For 4 bits per
block, there will be 64 bits per piece and 168 bytes per puzzle.

It turns out that there are 8 bits per block, so each block is 16 bytes.

The puzzle pieces start at 0x3a5 in each level file.

The pieces are positioned from left to right and from top to bottom when
arranged on screen, so the pieces as extracted from the level data are
placed in the following arrangement in order to reconstruct the complete
puzzle:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
  7  8  9  a  b  c  d
  e  f 10 11 12 13 14

Each piece is stored as a sequence of columns from left to right, with each
column containing four elements. So the bytes in a piece need to be arranged
in the following way when creating a sprite:

  0 4 8 c
  1 5 9 d
  2 6 a e
  3 7 b f
