The levels in the SLIPPER file start at 0xf7d. There are 5 levels per file.

Loading the SLIPPER file at 0x5403 in order to align the graphics to rows on
screen, it appears that the wall sprite starts at 0xabd.

Puzzle pieces are arrays of 4 by 4 blocks, with at least six different
colours: black, dark blue, blue, red, yellow and light blue. This means that
each piece should require at least 3 bits per block, so 12 bits per row, and
48 bits in total. Since each piece will be 6 bytes in total and there are 21
for each puzzle, we should look for sections of 126 bytes in length in each
level file.

If there are more bits required to represent a block then there will be
correspondingly more bytes required to represent a puzzle. For 4 bits per
block, there will be 64 bits per piece and 168 bytes per puzzle.

It turns out that there are 8 bits per block, so each block is 16 bytes.

The puzzle pieces start at 0x3a5 in each level file.
